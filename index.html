# Debugging Costs

Every node-hour spent incorrectly simulating physics costs $$$ with no return

# Debugging Costs

Let's offload correctness to computers rather than people. Let people focus on the problem they know.

# Certifloat Physics Compiler

The certifloat physics compiler does three things to save you time and money:

1. Ingests data in common oil&gas formats (e.g. POD binary, SEGY,...)
2. Generates an executable which simulates the specified physics (e.g. elastic wave equation)
3. Generates a [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) certificate proving the executable in (2) is correct
  1. This means you may treat the generated executable like an exact analytic solution
  2. This high confidence enables very robust testing

# Certifloat Physics Compiler

Your workflow otherwise does not change. Your geophysicists simply deliver more
valuable information to the software developers by way of rigorous
test cases. Cut out ambiguity and proceed directly to actionable
simulation results.

---


# Example (code)

```c++
/*file: acoustic.pde.*/
/*Purpose: A simple acoustic wave equation propagator.*/
/*Declare our three spatial dimensions. */
IndependentVariable x("x"), y("y"),z("z");
/*And of course, our time variable.*/
IndependentVariable t("t");

/*Now let's specify some inputs to our propagator.*/

/*An initial state that is a variable of x,y,z.*/
DependentVariable u0("u0",{x,y,z},format=FLOAT32_BINARY_GRID);
/*The speed of sound.*/
DependentVariable c("c",{x,y,z},format=FLOAT32_BINARY_GRID);

/*And finally the output is also a dependent variable.*/
DependentVariable u("u",{x,y,z},format=FLOAT32_BINARY_GRID);

/*Specify equation and boundary conditions to solve.*/
Domain dom({x,y,z},Cube({{0,1},{0,1},{0,1}}); /*Solve on a cube 0<=x,y,z<=1.*/
solve(
  diff(diff(u,t)) - (1.0/(c*c))*laplacian(u,{x,y,z}) = 0,
  u(x,y,z,t=0) = u0,
  dom,
  At(t={1.5,2.0,3.0,20.0}), /*To save space only ask for certain t values.*/
  Boundary(ALL_EXTERIOR) /*Solve with no-reflecting boundary conditions.*/
);
```

# Example (compiling)
Now you use the Certifloat Physics Compiler to generate an executable and Coq certificate

```bash
cpc acoustic.pde -exe acoustic.exe -coq acoustic.v
```

You can execute `acoustic.exe` with no arguments to see how to use it

```bash
./acoustic.exe
```
which outputs
```
USAGE: ./acoustic.exe  \
--u0 (u0_n1,u0_n2,u0_n3,u0_filename)  \
--c (c_n1,c_n2,c_n3,c_filename) \
--u (u_n1,u_n2,u_n3,u_n4,u_filename) \
--tol error tolerance
OUTPUTS: u_filename as float32 grid with specified dimensions
```

# The Takeaway

With the Certifloat Physics Compiler geophysicists can rapidly test _new
ideas_ with confidence that their code gives them exactly what they
asked for.

# The Takeaway

These ideas differentiate you from your competitors, and that is what
your human resource should be dedicated to, not endlessly debugging
complex code. Computers can now do this for them
